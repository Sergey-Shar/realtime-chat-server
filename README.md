# Realtime-chat(server)

## About project:

This project is a hub, which is a server part of the chat, in which the user can choose a room to connect to it and communicate with other participants of the room in real time.  The hub tells us who has connected to the room and who has left it, and also sends a list of all chat participants.

This functionality is implemented using  [ASP .NET Core SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/)

The client part of the application is implemented using  [React.js](https://ru.reactjs.org/)
